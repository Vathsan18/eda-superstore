# EDA Mini Project – Superstore Dataset

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the [Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) to uncover insights about sales, profits, discounts, and customer purchasing behavior across different regions and categories.

The main goal is to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies to support business decisions through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Objectives

The project covers the following key tasks:

1. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Generated mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical metrics for numerical features.

2. **Visualizations**  
   - Histograms and boxplots for numerical columns like `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, and `Quantity`.

3. **Correlation & Feature Relationships**  
   - Created a correlation matrix and pairplot to analyze inter-feature relationships.

4. **Pattern & Trend Identification**  
   - Explored profit trends by category, region, and discount level to detect outliers and key trends.

5. **Feature-Level Inferences**  
   - Derived business insights and inferences from the visual analysis.

## Key Findings

- **Technology** is the most profitable category, while **Furniture** shows minimal profit.
- **Higher discounts (>20%)** are strongly associated with **negative profits**.
- Most orders involve **low-quantity and low-sale transactions**.
- The **West region** contributes the highest to total profit.
- Sub-categories like **Tables** and **Bookcases** consistently incur losses.
